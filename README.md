A fancy little script to setup a new virtualhost in Ubuntu based upon the  
excellent virtualhost (V1.04) script by Patrick Gibson <patrick@patrickg.com> for OS X: https://github.com/pgib/virtualhost.sh  
and 
ivoba <https://github.com/ivoba> version for Ubuntu: https://github.com/ivoba/virtualhost.sh
